### 🌟 Introduction

In a world where technology's rapid stride is propelling us forward, the synergy between human ingenuity and computational prowess is a sight to behold. Inspired by the enlightening tunes of an ML podcast by CS50, I embarked on a captivating journey into the enchanting realm of Machine Learning, with a special focus on the alluring landscapes of Deep Learning. Behold my maiden ML creation - a symphony of prediction and numbers, affectionately named "Pricey."

### 🤖 How the Algorithm Unfolds

##### The Dance of Decision Trees 🌳
Imagine a non-parametric marvel of supervised learning - the Decision Tree. It's the master of classifications and regressions, adorned with a majestic hierarchical structure. At its heart lies a tapestry of nodes - roots, branches, internals, and leaves - orchestrating a grand spectacle of insights.

##### A Glimpse into Tomorrow 📅
The journey towards precision is paved with historical tales. Our protagonist, the model, undergoes an initiation rite involving immersive training with data from yesteryears. Armed with this wisdom, the model peers into the future, juxtaposing predictions with reality. As time evolves, the model's elegance evolves, promising an enchanting dance of future predictions. (TODO: Destiny unfolding in the FUTURE)

### 🚀 Embarking on Your Pricey Adventure

Ready to chart your course into the realm of price predictions? Fear not, for I've laid the path adorned with stars and Python scripts. Here's how:

1. **Prelude**: Set the stage with `pip install -r requirements.txt` to summon the necessary libraries.
2. **Unleash the Magic**: With a triumphant `python main.py`, cast the spotlight on your chosen ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc., "GOOGL" for Google Inc., "USD" for US Dollar). A journey through Yahoo Finance API and years of data awaits.
3. **Visual Enchantment**: Behold the symphony of visual storytelling as your model conjures a comparison between its predictions and the tantalizing dance of market reality.

### 🛠️ Behind the Technical Curtain

This magical experience is powered by a consortium of packages, each playing its enchanting role:

- 📊 `yfinance`: A mystical communicator with Yahoo Finance API.
- 🎲 `numpy`: A magician's bridge between the mystical API and the land of scikit-learn.
- 🧙‍♀️ `scikit-learn`: A sorcerer's tool for training the ML model.
- 🌌 `matplotlib`: An artist's canvas for crafting visual masterpieces.

### 🧪 Unveiling the Alchemical Art

Feel the urge to tinker and tune? You're invited to explore the alchemical chambers:

- 🔮 Alter the Passage of Time: With a mere adjustment of `start_date` and `end_date`, reshape the dimensions of your temporal voyage.
- 🌐 Embrace Limitations: Mind the server-side cap of 2000 requests per hour per IP. Alas, even magic has its constraints.
- 📈 Chart Uncharted Territories: Venture into diverse realms, exploring currencies and companies, as long as the proper ticker symbol guides your way.

### 🔮 The Road Ahead

As the curtains rise on my journey through the mystic landscapes of ML, the adventure is far from over 👨🏻‍💻. Ahead lies the alchemy of refinement, where the neural network shall attain newfound prowess. And as the algorithm matures, the journey shall unfurl into the realm of future predictions, a destiny waiting to be woven.

With Alchemical Wonder,
